The open source Castle GamesDomain

# What is it?

Castle GamesDomain was a program created by JaGEx for the website GamesDomain in about 1998, which ran for a couple years and had many fans. Subsequently, Yahoo bought and closed down the service, killing Castle GamesDomain.

This project seeks to create an open source (partly reverse-engineered) clone of the service. We've already gotten 99% of the sprites thanks to archive.org and some page flipping, and the code which is filled with the same cobwebs as they existed in 1998.

# Why?

Castle GamesDomain was kind of neat, so it would be great to have it working again.

# How?

Since everything is already decompiled and the media is there, what's left is to emulate the games. The sourcecode comes with an Eclipse project file, but it's possible to build under any IDE.
